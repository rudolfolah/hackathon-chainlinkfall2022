DeFi lending protocol for NFTs using Chainlink Oracles

## Running the Code
Directory structure:
- `contract`: lending protocol smart contract code written in Solidity, works with Truflation NFT Index
- `frontend`: React web app that interacts with the contract
- `riskoracle`: data gathering and processing Chainlink oracle using IPFS, Bacalhau and QuickNode

After deploying the contracts to Polygon testnet, you can [get LINK tokens from the testnet faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/).
