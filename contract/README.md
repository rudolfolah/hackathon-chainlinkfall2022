# Lender contract

Deploying to testnet requires that you set up a `.env` file with a `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` which is the account private key to use to deploy the contract.

```shell
# Re-format the code
npm run-script prettier

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Deploy to Polygon testnet
npm run-script deploy
```
